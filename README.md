# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Python
This is a Ticktacktoe game that is created using python. The name tic tac toe comes from a game by the same name, no longer played, in which players with their eyes closed tossed a pencil down onto a slate marked with numbers, and earned the score the number indicated--something like blind darts. The game dates to the mid- to late 1800s. Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.  Tic Tac Toe is a game that can be perfected, quite easily, to a point where one simply never loses. Not only that, it's so simple, one can memorize how to play it perfectly without ever having played it. Impossible implies it's actually impossible to win the game.
